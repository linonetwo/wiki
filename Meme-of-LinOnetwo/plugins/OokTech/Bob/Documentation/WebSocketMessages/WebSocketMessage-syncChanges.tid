description: Resync with a server after reconnecting

If your browser is disconnected from a wiki server this is the message used to
sync any updates made either in the browser or on the server.

While this is usable it should only be used indirectly through the `Reconnect`
button that appears when the browser has been disconnected from the server.

!!Inputs

|!Parameter |!Description |
|!since |The time that the browser detected that it was disconnected. Changes after this time will be synced. (No default) |
|!changes |A messageQueue object that contains the changes in the browser. (No default) |
|!wiki |The wiki that is trying to reconnect (No defalut) |

!!Usage

This is all handled automatically.
