caption: updateTiddlyWikiInfo
description: Update the description, plugins, languages and themes in tiddlywiki.info

This message can be used to modify the `tiddlywiki.info` file for the current
wiki.
You can change the list of plugins, themes or languages as well as the
description.

You can change one or more of the parts at the same time.

If you give a parameter with an empty string (like this `""`) than it will
clear the list of plugins/themes/languages.

!!Usage

Note: all parameters for this are optional.

|!Name |!Description |
|!description |A text description to replace the current one. (optional) |
|!pluginList |A list of plugin names to replace the current list of plugins in the form "OokTech/Bob tiddlywiki/katext" (optional) |
|!themeList |A list of themes to include in the wiki in the same form as the plugins. (optional) |
|!languageList |A list of languages to include in the wiki in the same form as the plugins (optional) |


Example: Build the current wiki in the default location

```
<$action-websocketmessage $type='buildHTMLWiki'/>
```

Note: If you make your own exclude list it is a good idea to include the
tiddlers in the default. They have no purpose in a single file wiki and may
cause errors.
