description: Fetch tiddlers from another wiki on the same Bob server

This message imports tiddlers from another wiki being served by the same Bob
server into the current wiki. It can optionally apply a filter to modify the
titles of imported tiddlers.

''Note:'' This makes new copies of the tiddler. Changes to the imported
tiddlers don't affect the original wiki and changes in the original wiki don't
affect the imported tiddlers.

!!Inputs

|!Parameter |!Description |
|!fromWiki |The name of the wiki to shut down. (No default) |
|!filter |The tiddlers returned by this filter are imported. (No default) |
|!transformFilter |Imported tiddlers have their titles transformed by this filter (No defalut) |
|!resolution |The method used to handle conflicts (default: `manual`) |

If nothing is given for the `fromWiki` or `filter` attributes than this message
does nothing. To determine the wikiName for a wiki look in the $:/WikiName
tiddler.

There are there options for `resolution`

* `manual` each tiddler is saved to a temporary tiddler for review and must be
  manually accepted or rejected.
* `conflict` tiddlers with local copies that have been modified more recently
  than the incoming version are saved in temporary tiddlers to be accepted or
  rejected.
* `force` all incoming tiddlers are saved regardless of any conflicts
