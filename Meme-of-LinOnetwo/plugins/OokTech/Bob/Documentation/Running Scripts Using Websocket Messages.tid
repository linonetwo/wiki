description: Run shell scripts from the wiki.

For safety it is set up so that you can only run messages that are defined in
the settings.

To define a script to run make a new entry in the `scripts` section of the
settings. The name is what you send in the websocket message, the value is the
command you want to run.

To run the `ls` command you put this in it:

`'test': 'ls'`

then you would make a button like this:

```
<$button>
  Test Script
  <$action-websocketmessage $type='runScript' name='test'/>
</$button>
```
