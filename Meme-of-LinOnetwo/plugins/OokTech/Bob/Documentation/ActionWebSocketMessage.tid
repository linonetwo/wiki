! Introduction

The ''action-websocketmessage''  widget is an [[action widget|ActionWidgets]]
that sends a websocket message to the websocket server on the node server
process.

See [[WebSocketMessages|$:/plugins/OokTech/Bob/WebSocketMessages]] for a
list of available messages and their descriptions.

This is how any non-automated interaction with he websocket server is done.

! Content and Attributes

The ''action-websocketmessage'' widget is invisible. Any content within it is ignored.

|!Attribute |!Description |
|$type |The name of the websocket message you are sending, from the list in [[WebSocketMessages|$:/plugins/OokTech/Bob/WebSocketMessages]] |
|$param |This was supposed to be the default parameter for messages but it isn't used. This will probably be removed in the future. |
|$tiddler |This is the title of a tiddler that can be sent along with the message. |
|//{any other attributes}// |Each other attributed is added to the message sent. Attributes are added using `attribute=value` syntax. |

! Examples

This will send a ping message to the server. All that it does is print out the
received message in the terminal running the node process.

This message will print out:

`{ type: 'test', attribute: 'value', source_connection: 0 }`

Note: the source connection may not be 0. The source connection is the
zero-based index of the browser connection to the server.

```
<$button>
  PING!
  <$action-websocketmessage $type='test' attribute=value/>
</$button>
```

<$button>
  PING!
  <$action-websocketmessage $type='test' attribute=value/>
</$button>

This will reset the tiddlywiki server. Note that if you press this button than
it will break your connection to the server and you will have to refresh the
page after the server has restarted.

```
<$button>
  Restart Server!
  <$action-websocketmessage $type='restartServer'/>
</$button>
```

<$button>
  Restart Server!
  <$action-websocketmessage $type='restartServer'/>
</$button>
