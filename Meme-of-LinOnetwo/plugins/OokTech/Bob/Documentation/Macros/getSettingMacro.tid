caption: getSetting Macro
tags: Macros

A convenience macro to return the value of a setting in the settings
pseudo-json structure.

This is needed because tiddlywiki doesn't support nested json objects and
the settings structure is faking it.

This is done relative to the tiddler given by the root parameter.

To fit with tiddlywiki as much as possible each level is separated by ##

{
  First: {
    Second: {
      Item: Value
    }
  }
}

Given the above JSON you could use this:

`<<getSetting key:"First##Second##Item">>`

note that you can leave out the `key:` part and use this:

`<<getSetting "First##Second##Item">>`

both would return `Value`

Note that this returns the first leaf reached. If you add extra levels that
don't exit to the end of the key they are ignored. So in the example if you
used First##Second##Item##this##changes##nothing than it would work the same
way.

!! Parameters

''key''

  The key to look up. If you are looking up a value that isn't on the root
  level than you separate each level's key by `##`, like
  FirstLevel##SecondLevel##key.

''root''

  (optional) the root tiddler for the settings. Defaults to
  `$:/WikiSettings/split`

!! Example

The code

`<<getSetting ws-server##host>>`

gives

<<getSetting ws-server##host>>
