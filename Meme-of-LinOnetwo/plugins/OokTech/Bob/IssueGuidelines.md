# If you are thinking about posting an issue

Thank you! More people being involved means we can make free software better
for everyone.

There are some guidelines to help create and support a functioning and
respectful environment.

## To help with tech support type issues here are a few things to check before you post an issue:

- Are you using the newest version? If not update to the newest version and see
  if the issue persists. If not than don't worry about creating a new issue for
  a resolved problem.
- Is your question already answered in the documentation? Check the
  [readme](https://github.com/OokTech/TW5-Bob),
  [configuration documentation](https://github.com/OokTech/TW5-Bob/blob/master/Configuration.md)
  and [general documentation](https://github.com/OokTech/TW5-Bob/tree/master/Documentation)
- Are you asking a question that is already part of another issue? If so add to
  the conversation in that issue instead of creating a new one to make it
  easier for people in the future to see progress being made.
- Is the question you are asking about this plugin or would it be better to ask
  it on the [TiddyWiki issues board?](https://github.com/Jermolene/TiddlyWiki5)
  This may not always be obvious so don't worry too much about this one, but
  take a moment to consider it before posting an issue.

## Some other guidelines

- Are you asking for free engineering work? The people who work on this project
  do so for their own reasons, please show them enough respect to not consider
  them your unpaid engineering department.
  - If you are part of a company with a team and are requesting some
    enterprise grade additions to help than we suggest you consider emailing
    info@ooktech.com and request a quote if you want a custom implementation.
  - One possible exception to this is education. We have a soft spot for
    education and often help where we can.
- @inmysocks, the lead on the project, is dyslexic. Please do not include text
  styling in your issues aside from code blocks if necessary. While using bold,
  italics, underlined or colored text may make certain parts of the text stand
  out more for you they are very difficult for some people, including the
  project lead, to read.
