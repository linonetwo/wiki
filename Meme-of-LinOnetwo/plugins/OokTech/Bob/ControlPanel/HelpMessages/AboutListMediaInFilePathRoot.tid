First click the `Fetch list of media in the filePathRoot folder` to get a list
of the media available, then click `Show List` to see a listing of all of the
media that you can display in the wiki.
Clicking on a file name will create a tiddler that displays the media file, it
can then be transcluded into other tiddlers to display the media like a normal
image tiddler.
