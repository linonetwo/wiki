title: $:/plugins/OokTech/Bob/Federation/FederatedNodeDiscovery

For the local network multicast udp is used to discover other Bob servers to
federate with.

If you have your server set up to announce itself than it will use a multicast
message on the local network to let any other Bob servers know that it is
there.

For nodes that are off the local network I will use Dodo. I am not sure about
packaging that with Bob.
